<h1 id="krita-godot-exporter">Krita Godot Exporter</h1>
<p>A Krita plugin that makes exporting images drawn/edited in krita to a
Godot project as automated as possible.</p>
<p>If your Krita image has a layer called “godot”, when you save the
image, png files will be created from each layer (except the layer
called “godot”). The png files are placed in a folder besides the .kra
file. The .png files have the same name as the respective layer.</p>
<p>You can add options in the layer name, inside curly braces, the
syntax is like so:
<code>layerName {option1=value1,option2=value2,option3=value3}</code></p>
<p>The following options are supported at this time: -
<code>path=&lt;path&gt;</code> specifies the folder to save the layer
to. Path is relative to the godot project folder that encompasses the
.kra file. By default (i.e. if the path option isn’t specified), layers
are saved in a folder that is placed besides the .kra file. With this
option, you can specifically choose a folder (relative to the godot
project) to save the layer to. - example:
<code>player {path=Scenes/Characters}</code>, will make the layer save
to <code>&lt;GodotProject&gt;/Scenes/Characters/player.png</code> -
<code>noexport=true</code> makes it so the layer does not get exported
automatically (i.e. it does not get saved as a png when the .kra file is
saved)</p>
<h2 id="usefullness">Usefullness</h2>
<p>When making art for Godot, you usually draw a bunch of stuff on
different layers, and you usually wanna save each layer individually.
This plugin will do this automatically, every time you save, thus saving
you time. All you need to do is ensure your image has a layer called
“godot”.</p>
